# Changing sprites to yours
Images are pretty easy to edit
****

## UI
Select any UI element from the [UI] object on the scene. 
Then in the Inspector window find the Image component, and in the Source Image box drag/select the desired sprite.

Important!

In order to be able to use an image in the UI, it must be Sprite. 
To convert the image into a sprite, you need to select it in the project and in the inspector window in the Texture type item select Sprite

## Level
The game level is made with the Tile grid system.
To work with the level, you will need to open the tile editing window:
Window->2D->Tile palette
